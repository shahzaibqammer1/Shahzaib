3-5. Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of someone else to invite. • Start with your program from Exercise 3-4. Add a print statement at the end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it. • Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of the new person you are inviting. • Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list.

print(guests_kashif[1]+" is not able to attend dinner tonight")

Add a print statement to the end of your program informing people that you found a bigger dinner table. • Use insert() to add one new guest to the beginning of your list. • Use insert() to add one new guest to the middle of your list. • Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list. • Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.

print(guests_kashif)

['Sabir', 'Imran', 'Zeeshan', 'Amir', 'Adnan']

print("Dear friends, We found a bigger dinner table. So I am inviting three more friends.")

guests_kashif.insert(0,'Kamran')

guests_kashif.insert(4,'Ahsan')

3-7. Shrinking Guest List: You just found out that your new dinner table won’t arrive in time for the dinner, and you have space for only two guests. • Start with your program from Exercise 3-6. Add a new line that prints a message saying that you can invite only two people for dinner. • Use pop() to remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list. Each time you pop a name from your list, print a message to that person letting them know you’re sorry you can’t invite them to dinner. • Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know they’re still invited. • Use del to remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list. Print your list to make sure you actually have an empty list at the end of your program.

print("Sorry Friends, Only two Friends can attend the Dinner")

guest1_removed=guests_kashif.pop(0)

print("Sorry "+guest1_removed+" You can't attend the dinner")

guest2_removed=guests_kashif.pop(0)

print("Sorry "+guest2_removed+" You can't attend the dinner")

guest3_removed=guests_kashif.pop(0)

print("Sorry "+guest3_removed+" You can't attend the dinner")

guest4_removed=guests_kashif.pop(0)

print("Sorry "+guest4_removed+" You can't attend the dinner")

guest5_removed=guests_kashif.pop(0)

print("Sorry "+guest5_removed+" You can't attend the dinner")

guest6_removed=guests_kashif.pop(0)

print("Sorry "+guest6_removed+" You can't attend the dinner")

print("Dear "+guests_kashif[0]+" you can attend the dinner tonight")

print("Dear "+guests_kashif[1]+" you can attend the dinner tonight")

del guests_kashif[0]

del guests_kashif[0]

print(guests_kashif)

Sorry Friends, Only two Friends can attend the Dinner

Sorry Kamran You can't attend the dinner

Sorry Sabir You can't attend the dinner

Sorry Imran You can't attend the dinner

Sorry Zeeshan You can't attend the dinner

Sorry Ahsan You can't attend the dinner

Sorry Amir You can't attend the dinner

Dear Adnan you can attend the dinner tonight

Dear Moeen you can attend the dinner tonight

3-9. Dinner Guests: Working with one of the programs from Exercises 3-4 through 3-7 (page 46), use len() to print a message indicating the number of people you are inviting to dinner.

guests_count_kashif=['Sabir','Shahid','Zeeshan','Amir','Adnan']

print("i am inviting "+str(len(guests_count_kashif))+" Poeple.")

i am inviting 5 Poeple.

4-1. Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these pizza names in a list, and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza. • Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza instead of printing just the name of the pizza. For each pizza you should have one line of output containing a simple statement like I like pepperoni pizza. • Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, that states how much you like pizza. The output should consist of three or more lines about the kinds of pizza you like and then an additional sentence, such as I really love pizza!

pizza_kashif=['Chicago Pizza','Siclian Pizza','Greek Pizza','Deep Disha Pizza']

for j in range(0,len(pizza_kashif)):

    print(pizza_kashif[j])

for i in range(0,len(pizza_kashif)):

    print("I like to Eat "+pizza_kashif[i]+" everytime")

print("I love Pizza")

Chicago Pizza

Siclian Pizza

Greek Pizza

Deep Disha Pizza

I like to Eat Chicago Pizza everytime

I like to Eat Siclian Pizza everytime

I like to Eat Greek Pizza everytime

I like to Eat Deep Disha Pizza everytime

4-2. Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!

animals_kashif=['goat','cow','buffalow']

for a in range(0,len(animals_kashif)):

    print(animals_kashif[a])

for b in range(0,len(animals_kashif)):

    print(animals_kashif[b]+" is a Halal Pet")

print("All these Animals give Milk")
